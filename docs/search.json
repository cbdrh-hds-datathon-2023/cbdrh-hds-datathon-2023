Currently, the only effective treatment for HIV is antiretroviral therapy, which involves life-long administration of combinations of these drugs. This medication stops the virus from multiplying by targeting different stages of viral replication. However, continual use of the same combinations of drugs may lead to the formation of drug-resistant viral strains, rendering similar combinations of drugs ineffective."

Guest experts will give introductory talks on:\n\nThe Antiretroviral Therapy in HIV synthetic dataset\nHIV medications and potential research questions\n\nTeam membership will be confirmed before the online introductory event and teams will be given a mini-activity to complete in the week leading up to the main event.\n\n\nThe main event (Friday 26th May)\nParticipants will work together in teams of four to propose a research question and develop and implement a data science pipeline to address the research question. There is no restriction on choice of software or type of research questions. The final product could be an interactive visualisation, a predictive analysis, a risk factor analysis, time series analysis, etc. Experts in HIV medications and data analysis will be in the room to help participants develop their research question and solution. At the end of the day, each team will present their research question and solution. Prizes will be awarded to the best submissions, evaluated by a panel of experts. Selected submissions may be included in a showcase and published on the CBDRH website or other suitable platform.\nLunch and morning tea and coffee will be provided for in-person participants. Dietary requirements can be noted in the EOI form."
