    "text": "The data\nParticipants will use the Antiretroviral Therapy in HIV Dataset synthetic dataset developed by a team at the CBDRH (healthgym.ai/antiviral-hiv). Human Immunodeficiency Viruses (HIV) are viruses that attack the human bodyâ€™s immune system. Currently, the only effective treatment for HIV is antiretroviral therapy, which involves life-long administration of combinations of these drugs. This medication stops the virus from multiplying by targeting different stages of viral replication. However, continual use of the same combinations of drugs may lead to the formation of drug-resistant viral strains, which make similar combination of drugs ineffective"

    "text": "The event\nStudents will work together in teams of four to propose a research question and develop and implement a data science pipeline to address the research question. There is no restriction on choice of software or type of research questions. The final product could be an interactive visualisation, a predictive analysis, a risk factor analysis, time series analysis, etc. Experts in HIV medications and data analysis will be in the room to help participants develop their research question and solution. At the end of the day, each team present their research question and solution. Prizes will be awarded to the best submissions, evaluated by a panel of experts."
