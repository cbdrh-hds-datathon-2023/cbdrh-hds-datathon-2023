You will be analysing the Antiretroviral Therapy in HIV dataset from [HealthGym.ai](https://healthgym.ai/).

The Health Gym is a growing collection of highly realistic and freely-accessible synthetic medical datasets that has been developed to allow users to prototype, evaluate, and compare machine learning algorithms.

The Anteretroviral Therapy in HIV dataset comprises viral loads, CD4 counts, and drug regimen information for 8,916 patients with HIV. 

You can learn more and download the dataset at [healthgym.ai/antiviral-hiv](https://healthgym.ai/antiviral-hiv/).

You are welcome to start exploring the data straightaway! The presentations at the [online information session](schedule.html) will help you understand the data further and provide inspiration for intersting research questions that could be addressed with the data.
